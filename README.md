# Boston-housing
Introduction
The thriving real estate market of Boston presents a myriad of opportunities and challenges for investors, homeowners, and policymakers. The dataset under analysis provides a comprehensive overview of properties across Boston, assessed in the fiscal year 2015. Comprising a wealth of information on 168,115 properties, the dataset offers insights into various attributes including, but not limited to, property identification, location, ownership details, and physical characteristics such as land area, year built, and number of rooms.
Goals of the Project
The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, regression analysis, and predictive modeling. The specific objectives and analysis techniques will depend on the research questions and goals of the project.
Research Questions
•	Are there specific geographic locations or property types in Boston that command higher property values?
•	Is there a discernible trend in property values over the years, considering the variables YR_BUILT and YR_REMOD?
•	What correlations exist between property value (AV_TOTAL) and other attributes of living area?
•	Is there a notable correlation between the year a property was built and its value?
•	How do the variables GROSS_AREA, YR_BUILT, U_BDRMS, LAND_SF, and NUM_FLOORS collectively impact the assessed property value (AV_TOTAL)?
